Barba Yianni's Grilled New Zealand Lamb Chops

Preparation Time: Marinate a minimum of 2 hours

Cooking Time: 10 minutes

Serves: 6-8

Ingredients:

31/2 to 41/2 pounds (1.36 kg) New Zealand Lamb Loin or Rib Chops, 1/2 to 11/2 inch (19 mm - 3.2 cm) thick, trimmed
Marinade:

1 cup Olive Oil
Juice of 2 Lemons
1/2 cup Dried Oregano, preferably Greek, or 1/2 cup chopped fresh
6 Garlic Cloves, chopped
1 teaspoon Salt
1/2 teaspoon Freshly ground Black Pepper.
Method:
Nick edges of chops in several places to prevent curling. In a small bowl, mix all marinade ingredients together into a paste and rub it all over the chops. Place chops in a shallow bowl and cover with any remaining marinade. Marinate for about 2 hours in the refrigerator. Let New Zealand Lamb come to room temperature before grilling.

Depending on the thickness, grill lamb chops on over medium-hot coals for 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once or twice. The chops should register 120° to 135°F (48° - 57°C) at the thickest part for rare to medium-rare. Set the lamb aside for about 5 minutes before serving.
